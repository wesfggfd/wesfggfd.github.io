## About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** at *Changchun Normal University*, with a strong foundation in natural language processing, deep learning, and machine learning. I am experienced with modern AI toolkits and passionate about applying AI algorithms to solve real-world problems.

I have hands-on experience in building models based on Transformer, LSTM, GRU, and more, particularly in recommendation systems and NLP pipelines. I‚Äôve also achieved **Top 10% in Kaggle competitions**, and won **2nd Prize in the National Undergraduate Computer Design Contest**.

My research interests include:
- **Multimodal Large Models for Visual Question Answering (VQA):** Exploring the integration of causal inference to enhance the generalization ability of multimodal models.
- **MedLLM:** Focusing on techniques to suppress hallucinations in medical language models, ensuring more reliable outputs.
- **Multimodal Medical Data Alignment and Fusion:** Investigating methods to align and fuse multimodal medical data for more effective analysis and decision-making.
